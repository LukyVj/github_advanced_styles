#Github Advanced Styles
##### An advanced stylesheet for github


--- 
## Why ? 
I decided to create this extension, since I needed some more styling for my own use.
Then I thought it could be cool to provide those changes to the people that may need the improvements I needed. 

## Features : 
- Highlight raws on hover 
- Better font aliasing
- [Need a special feature ? Open an issue for it !](https://github.com/LukyVj/github_advanced_styles/issues/new)

## Download : 
[githubAdvancedStyle.crx v0.0.1](https://github.com/LukyVj/github_advanced_styles/blob/master/githubAdvancedStyle.crx?raw=true)

## How to ? : 
[Download the extension](https://github.com/LukyVj/github_advanced_styles/blob/master/githubAdvancedStyle.crx?raw=true) and drag it in the extensions manager of google chrome (`chrome://extensions/`). 

Now, open github, and you're good to go :smiley:
